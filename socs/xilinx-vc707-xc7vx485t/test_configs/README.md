# Test configs

## Overview

This directory contains a set of `.esp_config.bak.*` files to test the file generators found in `/esp/tools/socgen`. This directory also contains a couple of scripts to check the correctness of the file generators.

## Configurations

These configurations should be named as `esp_config.bak.n` where `n` is a number to be compatible with the testing scripts.

## Scripts

### setup

The usage of the setup script is
```
$ ./setup.sh <n>
```
where `n` is the number in the file `esp_config.bak.n`. This testing script clears the existing `.esp_config.bak.*` files in the parent directory, copies `.esp_config.bak.n` into the parent directory, and also copies `.esp_config.bak.n` into the directory `~/espcryo-ai/socs/xilinx-vc707-xc7vx485t/socgen/esp/` so that when run, the GUI will load the desired testing configuration.

The file path `/espcryo-ai/` should be replaced with the file path to the top directory of the branch of `/esp/` that is being compared.

### test

The usage of the test script is
```
$ ./test.sh
```
This runs a series of `diff` calls that compare the versions of the files generated by the programs in `/esp/tools/socgen/`.
